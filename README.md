 Todo Task Management Web Application
 
 A full-stack Todo Task Management Web App built for the Katomaran Full Stack Hackathon. It allows users to log in with Google, manage personal and shared tasks, and receive real-time task updates. The project demonstrates full-stack engineering skills including OAuth authentication, REST APIs, WebSocket communication, and deployment.

üöÄ Features

- Google OAuth 2.0 login using Passport.js
- Full CRUD operations on tasks
- Task sharing via email or username
- Real-time task updates using Socket.IO
- Task filters: due today, overdue, by priority and status
- Responsive design for desktop and mobile
- Toast notifications and error handling
- Pagination and sorting of tasks
- Rate limiting and input validation

‚öôÔ∏è Tech Stack

- Frontend: React, Axios, React Router, Socket.IO Client, Toastify
- Backend: Node.js, Express, Mongoose, Passport.js, JWT, Socket.IO
- Database: MongoDB Atlas
- Authentication: Google OAuth 2.0
- Deployment:
  - Frontend: Vercel
  - Backend: Render / Railway
  - DB: MongoDB Atlas (Cloud-hosted)

üõ†Ô∏è Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository
```
git clone https://github.com/Yashica-M/katomaran-todo-app.git
cd katomaran-todo-app
```
2. Backend Setup (/server)
```
cd server
npm install
```

Create a .env file in /server with:
```
.env
PORT=5000
MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_atlas_uri
JWT_SECRET=your_secret_key
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_google_client_id
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_google_client_secret
CLIENT_URL=http://localhost:3000
```
Start the server:
```
npm start
```

3. Frontend Setup (/client)
```
cd ../client
npm install
```

Create a .env file in /client with:
```
REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:5000
```

Start the frontend:
```
npm start
```

üîê How OAuth 2.0 Works
Users authenticate with their Google account via OAuth.

The backend receives the Google user info and creates a JWT token.

The frontend stores the JWT and uses it for authenticated API requests.

üì¶ How Task Management Works
Each user has their own task list stored in MongoDB.

Tasks include: title, description, dueDate, priority, status, sharedWith.

Users can create, update, delete, and share tasks with other registered users.

üîÑ How Real-Time Updates Work
The backend uses Socket.IO to emit events like task-created, task-updated, etc.

The frontend listens to these events and refreshes the task list instantly for all users.

This enables collaborative task management in real-time.


Assumptions
Only Google login is implemented (not GitHub or Facebook)

Shared tasks are visible to invited users after accepting invitation (future improvement)

Minimal offline support ‚Äî currently limited to viewing cached UI

Only basic priority/status fields are supported (e.g., Low/Medium/High, In Progress/Done)
