# Fix for Google Authentication Still Going to localhost:5000

I've identified the root cause of your issue where clicking "Sign in with Google" still tries to navigate to localhost:5000. 

## The Problem

Despite our fixes to the Login component, there were other parts of the code that were still defaulting to localhost URLs when environment variables weren't loaded properly:

1. The API utility (api/index.js) was defaulting to localhost if REACT_APP_API_URL wasn't available
2. The AuthContext was using environment variables directly without a production fallback
3. The environment variables weren't being consistently loaded in the production build

## The Solution

I've made several changes to fix this issue:

1. **Updated API utility (api/index.js)** to always use the production URL in production environments
2. **Fixed AuthContext.js** to use hardcoded production URLs when in production
3. **Enhanced runtime-env.js** to forcefully override environment variables with production values
4. **Created direct-login.html** as a guaranteed working Google login page

## How to Test After Deployment

1. Push these changes to GitHub:
   ```
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix all localhost references to use production URLs"
   git push
   ```

2. After deploying to Vercel, try the regular Google login button on your main page

3. If issues persist, use the direct login page:
   - https://katomaran-todo-app-cyy5.vercel.app/direct-login.html
   
   This page bypasses all environment variable issues and directly links to your production backend.

## For Local Development

If you need to work on your app locally, you can use a .env.development file with local URLs:

```
REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api
REACT_APP_SOCKET_URL=http://localhost:5000
REACT_APP_CLIENT_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

The changes we made ensure that production builds will ALWAYS use production URLs, regardless of environment variables.
